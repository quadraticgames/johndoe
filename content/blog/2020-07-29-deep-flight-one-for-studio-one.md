Earlier this week **PreSonus** released **Deep Flight One** for **Studio One**, an expansion pack for **Presence XT**. As a refresher, Presence XT is Studio One's native virtual sample-player instrument (similar to Kontakt and EXS24).

The presets sound fantastic out of the box. There is definitely an outer-spacey-vibe to most of the patches. The standouts are the pads, the drones, and the soundscapes. Here is an example I recorded using a combination of six presets (all of the sounds in the clip below are from Deep Flight One):

Equally impressive is the way the library was constructed. The samples come from vintage synthesizers (including the Oberheim Four Voice and Synclavier), modular synth racks, and field recordings (!).

At the end of the day, Native Instrument's **Absynth** is still my go-to for building evolving, layered soundscapes. But Deep Flight One is a nice addition to Studio One and Presence XT, and I can definitely see using this library in my game projects.
