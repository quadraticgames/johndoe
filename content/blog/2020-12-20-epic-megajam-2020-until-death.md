Really happy to have put together a super-talented team for the one-week Epic MegaJam 2020, which concluded on December 11. Game jams provide so many tangible benefits, regardless of your experience level or skill set. Learning to work in a fast-paced environment with people you barely know (or maybe have never met) is a critical skill that is valuable not just in game design, but just about any workplace setting.

## About The Game

Our game entry - _Until Death...?_ - is a 3D platformer set in the afterlife. It tells the tale of two young lovers, Brandon and Maddy. Devastated by Maddy's tragic death, Brandon takes his own life. Struggling in a lost space somewhere between life, death, and heaven, can Brandon redeem his broken soul and connect with his soulmate before its too late?

Everything in this game - story, artwork, animations, music, models, and voice-overs - were all created from scratch in one week for the game jam. No pre-made or Marketplace assets were used. More detail on the game can be found **[on our itch.io page](https://quadraticgames.itch.io/until-death)**.
