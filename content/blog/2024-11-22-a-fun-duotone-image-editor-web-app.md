Creating [**Hue Two: A Duotone Zoo**](https://duotoneapp.netlify.app), a playful duotone image editor, was an exciting mix of creativity, coding, and collaborationâ€”with AI lending me a helping hand throughout the process. In this article, I'll walk through how I built this web app, the challenges I faced, and how AI provided key insights and solutions along the way.

[This app](https://duotoneapp.netlify.app) is an interactive tool that transforms images into vibrant duotone art. You can upload your own image or search for one using [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com), select two custom colors, and watch the magic unfold. It's designed to be fun and to use, ideal for anyone who wants to add artistic flair to their images.

### How AI Helped Build This App

As I mentioned, building this app wasnâ€™t a solo effortâ€”I had an AI assistant guiding me through various stages of development. Hereâ€™s how AI contributed:

- AI helped me come up with the app's concept and even suggested its whimsical name, "Hue Two: A Duotone Zoo" based on my love of Dr. Seuss :)
- It offered a clear, step-by-step explanation of how to manipulate image data using the HTML5 Canvas API.
- Whenever I hit a snag, such as cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues or functions not being detected, AI pinpointed the problem and guided me toward solutions.
- It also provided tailored advice, like restructuring my project folder and ensuring environment variables were correctly set for both local and production environments.
- Lastly, it created comprehensive inline documentation for all of the app's code!

It felt like having a junior developer by my side, handling much of the heavy lifting and routine tasks, which freed me up to focus on crafting the user experience and styling the application. Sure, I can write CSS media queries to make the app mobile responsive, but why not delegate that (repetitive) task to my AI assistant and focus my energy on the bigger picture?

### Step-by-Step: Building the App

#### **Step 1: Laying the Foundation**

The project started with a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup. The appâ€™s core components included:

- A file input for uploading images.
- A search bar for fetching images from Unsplash.
- Two color pickers for selecting duotone colors.
- A canvas element for previewing the image transformations.

#### **Step 2: Adding the Duotone Effect**

The HTML5 Canvas API became the backbone of the app. Using AI's guidance, I applied the duotone effect by first converting each pixel to grayscale and then mapping it to a gradient between the two selected colors. Here's a snippet of the logic:

```
const grayscale = 0.3 * data[i] + 0.59 * data[i + 1] + 0.11 * data[i + 2]; data[i] = color1.r + (color2.r - color1.r) * (grayscale / 255);
```

AI explained this calculation clearly and even helped debug rendering issues when the preview didnâ€™t look quite right.

#### **Step 3: Securing the Unsplash API Key**

To fetch random images from Unsplash, I needed to securely handle my Unsplash API key. AI recommended using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) serverless functions. Hereâ€™s the code for the function.

```
const axios = require('axios');

exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
    const { query } = event.queryStringParameters;
    const apiKey = process.env.UNSPLASH_API_KEY;

    try {
        const response = await axios.get(`https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random`, {
            params: { query },
            headers: { Authorization: `Client-ID ${apiKey}` }
        });
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify(response.data),
        };
    } catch (error) {
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to fetch from Unsplash' }),
        };
    }
};
```

#### **Step 4: Deploying on Netlify**

Netlify made deployment seamless. AI walked me through:

1. Connecting my GitHub repository to Netlify.
2. Configuring a `netlify.toml` file to specify the `functions` directory
3. Adding the Unsplash API key to Netlify's environment variables.

```
[build] functions = "netlify/functions"
```

Within minutes, the app was live and accessible to the world!

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Image Processing Performance**: The initial image manipulation process was slow for large images. AI suggested scaling the image to a maximum width/height before applying the effect, significantly improving performance.
2. **CORS Issues with Unsplash**: Directly fetching images from Unsplash in the front-end caused CORS errors. AI recommended using a serverless function as a proxy to solve this problem. Nice!
3. **Debugging Environment Variables**: While testing locally, the Unsplash API wasnâ€™t working. AI helped identify a missing `.env` configuration and explained how to set up environment variables correctly in Netlify.

### Final Touches: Design and User Experience

The appâ€™s design was crafted to be simple and fun:

- **App Logo**: Sticking with the Dr. Seuss theme, I found a free font online that mimics the signature lettering style from his books and used it to design the text-based logo.
- **Typography**: I picked Google Fonts' **Sour Gummy**, giving the app a playful look.
- **Buttons**: Colorful buttons with hover effects make interactions more engaging.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Key Takeaways

Collaborating with AI was like having a 24/7 coding mentor. It wasnâ€™t just about getting answersâ€”it was about learning. Hereâ€™s what stood out:

- **Faster Development**: AI accelerated problem-solving, from debugging to structuring serverless functions.
- **Deeper Understanding**: AI didnâ€™t just give solutions; it explained them, helping me grow as a developer.
