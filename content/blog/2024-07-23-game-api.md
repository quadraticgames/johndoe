In the world of gaming, **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** have become a crucial tool for developers and enthusiasts alike. They allow for the creation of custom applications, detailed analytics, and enhancements that can take the gaming experience to the next level.

While many people know that building mods for popular games is a great gateway into learning about game development and game design—and can even help you land a job in the industry—another fun, and often overlooked, alternative is using game APIs to create robust companion apps. Let's explore three popular platforms with exceptional APIs and discuss what kinds of projects you can create with them.
