Just released a new game for a game jam (although, it didn't make the submission list, long story...). The name of the game is _**J.P. Winkle's Jungle Hunt!**_ and it is a 3D walking simulation / treasure hunt built in Unreal Engine. The jam was one-week long, although this game came together in about four days. This was my first collaboration with my son John Stallings, who did the voiceover work. The theme of the game jam was "discovery."

I always like to challenge myself in specific areas during game jams. What I wanted to do here was focus on firing off audio based on game conditions, building a simple quest system, and also [Fridai](https://hellofridai.com/) implementation (which unfortunately I did get to do as they had some technical issues during the jam).
