I am honored and humbled to have been one of only 50 developers around the world to be invited to the [Core Invitational](https://invitational.coregames.com/) This game development contest runs from August 12 to September 13 and includes a whopping $140,000 in prizes (including a Tesla Model 3)!

Core is a universe of more than 20,000 (free) games to play and worlds to explore designed by a global community of creators. Content creators use the Core Editor, which is a streamlined version of Unreal Engine. In addition to building a game for the Invitational, I am journaling my experience with the Core Editor and will describe how it fits in as a creation tool in the Epic Games ecosystem (along with Unreal Engine and Fortnite Creative).
