## About the Game

A mysterious entity appeared above Earth years ago. After finding out the planet was populated by space cats we built a space elevator directly connecting both planets to start trading with the cats. Today is your first day on the job and you botched your first delivery to the cat planet! After a rough landing your elevator is severely damaged. Do deliveries, make repairs, buy upgrades, and try your darnedest to get back “down to earth”!
