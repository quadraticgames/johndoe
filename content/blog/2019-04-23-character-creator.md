I have completed another small project for a larger game project I am contributing to. This project is a 3D character editor for a sports game. The screen shots below show the progression from the original draft to the final version.

This was a fantastic introduction to the visual scripting system **[Playmaker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/playmaker-368)**(a Unity asset) as well as a good project for drilling deeper into Unity's UI canvas.

Here is the first draft of the editor scene:

And here are screen grabs from the completed scene:
