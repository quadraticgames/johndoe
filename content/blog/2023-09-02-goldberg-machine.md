I am always on the lookout for innovative ways to merge technology with education. And what better way to do that than with Unreal Engine? As an instructor, I've found that Unreal Engine offers a unique platform for teaching STEM concepts in an engaging and interactive manner. One of the most exciting lesson plans I've come across recently is the **[Unreal Learning Kit on Rube Goldberg Machines](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/lesson-plans/unreal-learning-kit-rube-goldberg-machines)**.

### **Who was Rube Goldberg?**

Rube Goldberg gained widespread recognition for his cartoons. They featured elaborate and roundabout contraptions that accomplished simple tasks.

Goldberg's machines, famously known as "Rube Goldberg machines," were intricately crafted contraptions created to execute uncomplicated tasks. They operated by triggering a sequence of events, where each action set off the next, like balls rolling, pulleys shifting, or levers tugging, until the final objective was accomplished. These marvelous contrivances were often assembled using ordinary items found in daily life, blended with a touch of wit and absurdity, resulting in delightful visuals.

> The culmination of these lessons is a project where students design their own Rube Goldberg machine using all the simple machines they've learned about.

### **Unreal Learning Kit: Rube Goldberg Machines**

This [new Unreal Learning Kit](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/lesson-plans/unreal-learning-kit-rube-goldberg-machines) is a comprehensive resource that delves into the fascinating realm of Rube Goldberg Machines. It gives us all the necessary tools to seamlessly integrate science concepts, such as simple machines and physics, into our curriculum. And by leveraging the power of Unreal Engine, it also enables learners to master interactive 3D skills, adding an immersive element to their educational experience.

The lessons, designed for students 13 and older, are structured around various simple machines:

1. **Inclined Planes**: Students begin in a kitchen-themed level, learning to alter the trajectory of an orange using dynamic inclined planes
2. **Levers**: This lesson focuses on understanding balanced and unbalanced forces using simple levers.
3. **Wedges**: Students use wedges to slice watermelons, understanding the impact of altering wedge angles.
4. **Wheel & Axle**: A lesson centered around using a Lazy Susan to push a ball into a bucket.
5. **Pulleys**: Students use a pulley to complete a chain reaction, manipulating it using various tools.
6. **Screws**: Here, students use a screw to transport a sphere and learn about Splines for creating ramps.

The culmination of these lessons is a project where students design their own Rube Goldberg machine using all the simple machines they've learned about. How cool is that?!

### Mastering Unreal Engine

Delving into Rube Goldberg Machines with this Learning Kit provides more than just an understanding of intricate apparatuses. As students explore these fascinating contraptions, they are also embarking on an introductory journey into the world of Unreal Engine. The kit ensures that while students grasp the complexities of the machines, they also familiarize themselves with key features of the Unreal Engine platform. Some of the things students will learn include:

- Grasping the fundamentals of the Unreal Engine interface and its navigation
- Learning how to move, rotate, and scale objects within a 3D environment
- Activating physics and collision mechanisms for objects
- Creating and applying custom textures and materials
- Implementing the Chaos Destruction system
- Getting hands-on with Blueprints, Unreal Engine's intuitive visual coding system
- Adding sounds to objects
- Sculpting and editing 3D models with Unreal Engineâ€™s Modeling Mode

This holistic approach ensures that newcomers to Unreal Engine gain a comprehensive foundation, readying them for more advanced undertakings in the future.

### **Why I Love Using Unreal Engine for STEM**

As an instructor, Unreal Engine has revolutionized the way I approach teaching STEM. The engine's interactive 3D capabilities make abstract concepts tangible. Students aren't just learning about physics or engineering; they're experiencing them firsthand in a virtual, real-time environment. This hands-on approach not only makes learning more engaging but also ensures better retention of concepts. Moreover, Unreal Engine's awesome dev community and plethora of resources mean that I'm continually finding new ways to enhance my lessons and offer my students the best possible learning experiences.

The Unreal Learning Kit on Rube Goldberg Machines is just one example of how Unreal Engine can transform STEM education. As we continue to explore the possibilities, one thing is clear: the future of education is interactive, immersive, and incredibly exciting!
