Over the past several days I've been learning how to do cinematics in Unreal Engine. If you have ever used Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple's Final Cut, etc., you should find the workflow relatively intuitive.

In the 60 second clip below, I learned about cinematic cameras, fades, animation, and spawning post FX within Unreal Engine's sequencer. I also wrote a bit of music and added some Foley ambiance.

Big shout out to @Sweets (from our [Discord](https://discord.gg/789urVY) channel) who not only wrote the monologue, but also did the voiceover! Great learning experience all around.
