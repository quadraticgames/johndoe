**_Drone Mountain_** is a semi-realistic drone / quad-copter simulation thatÂ  I built in Unreal Engine. A quad-copter is a multi-rotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. You can pilot your drone in an Arctic environment with a control scheme that is similar to what real-world drone pilots (like me :) ) use.

The game also includes a really neat Photo Mode. Once entering Photo Mode (P), there are a number of controls you can use to frame your shot and add visual effects. These are all outlined in the Photo Mode interface. Note that the photos are saved to C:\\temp. If that directory does not exist on your computer, the photos will not be saved.

The game is free to download and play, [and you can get it over at itch.io](https://quadraticgames.itch.io/drone-mountain).
