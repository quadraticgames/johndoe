I've just released a new album on Spotify - "Machina Vol. 1: Dawn." Machina is a multi-album musical concept project containing songs composed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools (AI), performed by virtual performers (software instruments), and mastered using AI.

Machina Vol. 1: Dawn is a collection of piano sonatas. Each piece is performed on a sampled Bösendorfer Model 290 Imperial piano. Bösendorfer, one of the world's oldest piano manufacturers, was established in 1828 and in 1830, it was granted the status of official piano maker to the Emperor of Austria. The Bösendorfer piano used on this album was recorded with vintage Neumann microphones, Meitner AD converters and a vintage 8078 Neve console.

Although I did a bit of arrangement on my own, added some humanization, and changed a note here or there, the bulk of the composition was built through AI "listening" to influence tracks and performing in a key, tempo, and style I directed. Influence tracks included everything from pop and classic rock to classical music and jazz. The title of each song on the album gives a hint as to the source influence.

Note that this album is also (or will be shortly) available on YouTube Music, iTunes, Amazon, etc.

On to Volume 2!
