[_**dy5topia**_](https://www.coregames.com/games/7dd693/dy5topia) is my submission for "[DYSTOPIAN WORLDS: a deadmau5 x Core Collab Jam](https://deadmau5.coregames.com/)." The jam objective was to create a dystopian world using Core.

There are no specific game objectives, as this is more of a interactive visual level. However, I found myself wanting to to explore some of the characters I dropped into the level. For instance, what happened to the man in front of Tech Thrash? Why is a woman trying to meditate outside in the rain? What are the three women in front of the holo-terminal looking at (or for)? How is a person's Life Value (LV) calculated (as seen in the UI)?
